# Drug-prediction-SVM-
This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the right drug for patients based on features like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and Na-to-K ratio. After preprocessing with label encoding and scaling, the model is trained and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1-score for effective drug classification.
This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning algorithm, to predict which type of drug a patient should be prescribed based on their personal and medical attributes. Drug prediction is a significant application in healthcare analytics because it can help doctors and researchers make data-driven decisions about treatments. The dataset typically contains patient information such as Age, Sex, Blood Pressure (BP), Cholesterol level, and Na-to-K ratio, along with the target variable Drug type (categorical classes such as Drug A, Drug B, etc.).

The workflow begins by importing necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and explored to understand feature distributions and relationships. Since some of the features, such as Sex, BP, and Cholesterol, are categorical, they are transformed into numeric values using Label Encoding. This preprocessing step ensures the data is in a suitable format for SVM, which operates on numerical values.

The dataset is then divided into independent features (X) and the target variable (y). Next, the data is split into training and testing sets (commonly 70-30 or 80-20 split). Feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler) may be applied to normalize numerical values, as SVM models are sensitive to differences in scale.

An SVM classifier is then built using scikit-learn’s SVC class. Different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF)) can be experimented with, but RBF is commonly used because it can handle non-linear relationships between features. The model is trained on the training data, learning to separate the feature space with an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between drug classes.

Predictions are made on the test data, and the model’s performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report (precision, recall, and F1-score). High accuracy indicates that the SVM is effective at classifying patients into the correct drug categories.

Overall, the SVM-based drug prediction model demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to healthcare to assist in decision-making. While the model provides good baseline results, further improvements may involve hyperparameter tuning (C, gamma, kernel), handling class imbalance, and comparing SVM’s performance with other models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Logistic Regression.
